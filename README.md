Zone Shrinker
1. Level system. there will be multiple levels. for each consecutive level the zone gets shorter, special circles rate increase and decrease (depends on powerup). (700*700 res, gets 140 shorter (x and y axis) each level) 
2. there will be health system for spaceship which stays same no matter level. 
3. multiple Special circles, one with multiple hitpoints, rarer special that breaks and turns into radom projectiles that destroys nearby circles (harder, will skip if proven too complicated), one that increases health, one that negates one missed circle, some will aim for the spaceship, one for each powerups, one that progresses level
4. Level progression:  scored based, after reaching a set goal score, level will progress 
5. Powerup keyboard button but with limited counter: Invincibility, limited bullets that shoots at multiple direction (handle using math.sin/cos(angles)), limited time barrier that doesn't let any circle miss (all replenishes via special circle, max capacity when starting)

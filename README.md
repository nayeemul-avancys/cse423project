Zone Shrinker
1. Level system. there will be multiple levels. for each consecutive level the zone gets shorter, circles faster, special circles rate increase and decrease (depends on powerup). there would be 5 levels. (700*700 res, gets 140 shorter (x and y axis) each level) Complete all to get congratulations, lose once and get game over
2. there will be health system for spaceship which stays same no matter level. 
3. multiple Special circles, one with multiple hitpoints, rarer special that breaks and turns into radom projectiles that destroys nearby circles (harder, will skip if proven too complicated), one that increases health, one that negates one missed circle, one that slows circle speed for limited time, some will aim for the spaceship, one for each powerups
4. Level progression:  scored based, after reaching a set goal score, level will progress 
5. Powerup keyboard button but with limited counter: Invincibility, limted bullets that shoots at multiple direction (handle using math.sin/cos(angles)), limited time barrier that doesnt let any circle miss (all replenishes via special circle, max capacity when starting)
